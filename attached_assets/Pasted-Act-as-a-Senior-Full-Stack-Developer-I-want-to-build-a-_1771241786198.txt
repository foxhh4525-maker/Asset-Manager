Act as a Senior Full Stack Developer. I want to build a web application called "StreamerClipHub".
The goal is to allow a streamer's community to submit funny or epic YouTube Clips, and for the streamer to view them in a seamless "Queue/Playlist" mode during live streams.

Here are the detailed specifications and business logic:

### 1. Tech Stack (Mandatory):
- **Framework:** Next.js 14 (App Router).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (Dark Mode, Gaming/Streamer aesthetic).
- **Database & Auth:** Supabase (PostgreSQL).
- **Authentication:** Discord OAuth2 (Strictly Discord login only).
- **Language:** TypeScript.

### 2. User Roles & Workflows:

#### A. The Viewer (Submitter):
1. **Login:** Must log in via Discord to prevent spam.
2. **Submission:**
   - Input field for YouTube URL.
   - **CRITICAL VALIDATION:** The system must strictly validate that the URL matches the pattern `youtube.com/clip/` or `youtu.be/clip/`. Reject any other YouTube links (like full videos or Shorts).
   - **Metadata Fetching:** On paste, use YouTube Data API to fetch: Clip Title, Thumbnail, Duration, and Channel Name.
   - **Tags:** User selects a tag (e.g., Funny, Skill, Fail, Glitch).
3. **Spam Prevention:**
   - Prevent duplicate links.
   - Limit submissions (e.g., 1 clip per 5 minutes per user).

#### B. The Public (Voting Arena):
- A "New" and "Top Rated" feed.
- Users can Upvote/Downvote clips.
- Clips with high downvotes are auto-hidden.

#### C. The Streamer (Dashboard Mode):
- **Cinema Mode:** A dedicated page with a large video player.
- **Queue Logic:**
   - A sidebar showing the "Pending Clips" queue.
   - **Auto-Play/Next:** When a clip ends, or when the streamer clicks "Next", the next clip in the queue loads instantly without page refresh.
- **Action Buttons:** "Mark as Watched" (removes from queue), "Ban User" (for bad links).

### 3. Database Schema (Draft Idea):
I need you to design the schema for:
- `users` (discord_id, username, avatar, role).
- `clips` (url, title, thumbnail_url, submitted_by, status, upvotes, created_at).
- `votes` (user_id, clip_id, value).

### 4. Your Task Now:
Please provide the following to get me started:
1. The **Project Structure** for Next.js.
2. The **Supabase SQL Schema** code to create the tables.
3. The **API Route Logic (in TypeScript)** for validating the YouTube Clip URL and fetching metadata.
4. The **Frontend Component** code for the "Streamer Cinema Mode" that handles the queue playback.
